OLD CHANGE LOGS FOR THE HOMEWORK EDITION:
(* indicates a big/important change)

--------
2.01    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Redefined '\mid' to autoscale to the same size as the delimiters
        surrounding it.
    2. Added the operator '\Frac' for the field of fractions.
    3. Added operators '\ann', '\tor', '\End', and '\bigboxplus'.
   *4. Redefined the delimiters using the '\DeclarePairedDelimiter{}' command
        from the 'mathtools' package, and switched definitions of starred
        versions so that non-starred versions auto-scale, and starred versions
        do not.
    5. Added command '\divides', which places a vertical bar with nice spacing
        into math environments. This bar is slightly longer than the height
        of normal ordinals, so that
            \abs{A} \divides \abs{B}
        looks nice. There is also a new negated version: '\ndivides'.
    6. Added the 'tikz-cd' package for creating commutative diagrams.
    7. Added the tikz library 'arrows'.
   *8. This project is now using the LPPL license. See the README.
    9. Page dimensions have been redefined, via the geometry package.
   10. Removed the `imakeidx` package. This feature is now found in the new
        'NOTES' preamble.
   11. Removed the `fancyvrb` package. This feature is now found in the new
        'NOTES' preamble.
   12. Moved the definition of 'bar' to the 'Functions' section.
   13. Added '\bigboxplus', which behaves like '\bigoplus'.
  *14. This preamble is now under the filename 'homework_preamble.tex'
   15. Changed all '\def' occurances to '\newcommand' or '\renewcommand'.
   16. Added the 'Hom' operator.
   17. Added a couple of necessary lines that are used when creating the format
        file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------
2.0    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *1. The preamble.tex file has been completely revamped and is now much more
        readable.
   *2. This README has also been completely revamped with the same aestetic
        changes as the preamble.
    3. Added the command '\mpar{@}' to serve as a replacement for
        '\marginpar{@}'.
    4. Updated '\signchart' to handle any input for the first argument.
   *5. 'signchart' is now a package, and can be found on CTAN!
    6. Added the auto-scaled delimiter '\brkt{@}' for square brackets [ ]
    7. Now loads tikz library 'shapes'
    8. Re-defined the '\circled{@}' command to use an ellipse rather than a
        circle
    9. Added the package 'microtype' for better looking output
    10. Added the package 'multicol' for creating balanced multiple column
        sections of the document.
    11. Removed all of the alternative fonts. Keeping in mind that this will be
        a class someday, this feature is rather silly.
    12. I changed the name of this collection from 'MOTTAZ UNIVERSAL LaTeX
        PREAMBLE' to 'the MOTTAZ STANDARD LaTeX PREAMBLE'.
    13. Added the package 'imakeidx' for inserting an index into the document.
    14. Added command '\framedntheorems' to place frames around numbered
        theorems
    15. Redefined '\limsup' and '\liminf' so that they are actual operators.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.7    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Fixed top & bottom spacing for the following environments: nthm, nlem,
        nprop, ncor, thm, lem, prop, cor, defn, exmp, sol, case.
   *2. There is another preamble! This one is for writing quizzes. Look for the
        'quiz_preamble.tex' file.
    3. Redefined '\Re' and '\Im' so that it prints 'Re' and 'Im' instead of the
        fraktur font variant
    4. Added math operator '\fun' for the set of all functions
    5. Added the double stroke character '\H' for the Quaternions/Hamiltonions
    6. Redefined the '\bar{@}' command to make it slightly wider and auto-scale
        with the input.
    7. Removed the '\cconj{@}' command. I believe this to be too specific when
        '\bar{@}' is intuitive and does the job nicely.
    8. Added '\cis' operator as shorthand for 'cos _ i sin'
    9. Added '\Arg' operator for the Principal Argument of a complex number
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------
1.6    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *1. Changed the '\signchart' command so that entering signs is MUCH simpler.
        New syntax: '\signchart{1,2,3}{+,-,+,-}'
    2. Added the 'xkeyval' package for creating key-value pairs for macros
    3. Added key-value options to '\signchart' to change the width of the chart
        or the height of the symbols, as well as the arrowheads.
    4. Fixed bug in '\signchart' definition so that there is no limit to the
        number of characters in a symbol.
    5. Added command '\paren{@}' which places its contents inside of auto-scaled
        parentheses.
    6. Added the ceiling and floor functions using the commands '\ceil{@}' and
        '\floor{@}'.
    7. Changed the default font to 'Latin Modern'. This helps to avoid weird
        typesetting issues.
    8. Added the command '\cconj{@}' which places a bar over the argument.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------
1.5    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Switched from the 'enumerate' package to the 'enumitem' package.
        'enumitem' offers much more customization options than 'enumerate'. The
        'enumerate' package was loaded with the 'shortlabels' option, so TeX
        documents written with previous versions of the preamble are not
        affected.
    2. Added the 'tabularx' package for customization options in tabular
        environments.
    3. Added the 'arydshln' package for inserting dashed lines in tabluar/array
        environments.
    4. Added a new theorem style 'Case' in the same style as 'Definition'.
    5. Added the package 'array' for further customizations of tabular/array
        environments. Specifically, we inserted the global commad
        '\setlength{\extrarowheight}{1pt]' to fix the issue of capitol letters
        touching the horizontal lines in a table/array.
    6. Added the command '\set{@}' which places the contents inside of
        automatically scaled curly braces.
    7. Added the packages 'textgreek' and 'upgreek' for inserting upright greek
        letters in text mode and math mode, respectively.
    8. Added the option 'unicode' to the 'hyperref' package so that if greek
        letters are used in a hyperlink, they will be nicely replaced with their
        unicode analogs in the side panel/contents of the PDF viewer
    9. Changed the definition of the doublestroke character '\C' using
        '\renewcommand', since apparently one of these new packages defined that
        command already.
    10. Changed the header text to small caps shape.
    11. Added the 'fancyvrb' package for customizaton of the verbatim
        environments.
    12. Added the option 'align = margin' to itemize environments to place item
        labels in the left margin.
   *13. Created a usage guide which explains LITERALLY EVERYTHING there is to
        know about this preamble. If you think there is anything it does not
        cover, let me know ASAP.
    14. Added commands '\frameddefinitions' and '\framedtheorems'. When put in
        the preamble of your document, 'definition' and
        'theorem/lemma/proposition/corollary' environments will be placed
        inside of a frame.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Added commands '\coursetitle{@}', '\hwtitle{@}', and '\myname{@}' to
        populate the header
    2. Changed PGFPlots compatability to version 1.10. After some research, I
        found that leaving the 'compat' variable as 'newest' is not the best
        idea.
    3. Added PGFPlots library 'fillbetween' which allows the user to name plots
        and add a fill color in between two plots
    4. Added option 'dvipsnames' to 'xcolor' package to allow for the use of the
        68 standard colors in dvips
    5. Needed to load the 'xcolor' package before the 'pgfplots' package to
        avoid option clash (since 'pgfplots' also loads 'xcolor')
    6. Added the package 'float' for the placement character 'H', which places 
        the figure "here no matter what"
   *7. Redefined page layout dimensions in terms of paper size and text size, so
        that the user will see a nice layout no matter which page size/text size
        they choose. The layout has been optimized to conform with standard
        typography guidelines. For 'letterpaper' size and 11pt or 12pt font, the
        text spans within the recommended range of 60-75 characters per line,
        and at 10pt font the user will see around 75-85 characters per line,
        which is only slightly outside of this recommended range. As part of
        this adjustment, the margin size was expanded for the added benefit of a
        more "useful" margin. That is, longer margin notes are readable and no
        longer appear with one or two words per line. Inspiration for this
        change came from the discussion on this thread:
      tex.stackexchange.com/questions/71172/why-are-default-latex-margins-so-big
    8. Added numbered versions of theorem, lemma, proposition, and corollary
        environments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------
1.3    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Added command '\darktheme' to invert colors on output PDF. This is to
        reduce eye strain while creating/editing TeX documents.
    2. Added command '\circled{@}' which places a circle around the argument in
        inline text.
    3. Added the 'IMPORTANT NOTES' section to the README file.
    4. Added command '\signchart{<numbers>}{<string array>}' which generates a
        sign chart
    5. Created a working example of this new feature
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------
1.2    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Added more footnote symbols, adjusted code for improved readability
    2. Avoided potential footnote counter error by having symbols multiply when
        needed
    3. 'pdfpages', 'cleveref', 'wasysym', 'needspace', 'lipsum', and 'alphalph'
        packages added
    4. Redefined the proof environment so that if only 3 lines or fewer fit on a
        page, the entire proof will begin on a new page
    5. Small adjustments to theoremstyle definitions
    6. Added commands for choosing alternative fonts.
    7. Improvement of readability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------
1.1    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *1. Created this README file
    2. Redefined '\headheight' to account for different font size selections
    3. Changed '\pgfplotsset{compat=1.9}' to '\pgfplotsset{compat=newest}' for
        simplified backwards compatibility in the future
    4. Expanded list of symbols/math operators
    5. Removed '\myfrac'. This was temporarily defined for a specific use, and
        was not intended for the universal preamble.
    6. A comprehensive description of how to define a fraction-like object was
        added in case this is desired in the future.
    7. 'Goals for the future' was transferred to this README file. I believe
        this is a more appropriate location for this list.
