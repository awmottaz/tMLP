%% THE MOTTAZ PREAMBLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Created by: Tony Mottaz
%% Description: This is my customized preamble with which I write all of my homework assignments.
%% It is ever-expanding to fit new and nitpicky uses.

%% Current version: 1.0
%% Published to: Copy.com
%% Publish Date: 10/8/2015

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% GOALS FOR THE FUTURE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% -- Redevelop into a document class rather than a preamble
% -- Create other preambles based on this one for other uses

%% HOW TO USE: Include the line '\input{/path/to/preamble.tex}' before '\begin{document}' in your .tex file


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% SET THE LAYOUT OF THE PAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% NOTE: This layout assumes that the user is using the letterpaper size. Specify this by using
%		\documentclass[letterpaper]{•} 
%		at the beginning of your .tex document.

\usepackage{layout}
\hoffset 0.25in
\voffset 0pt
\oddsidemargin 0pt
\topmargin 0pt
\headheight 12pt
\headsep 25pt
\textheight 600pt
\textwidth 6in
\marginparwidth 85pt


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\usepackage{mathtools,amsthm,amssymb}	% For basic math typesetting needs
\usepackage{dsfont,mathrsfs}			% For double stroke fonts (\mathds{•}) and math script fonts (\mathscr{•})
\usepackage[textwidth=0.9\marginparwidth]{todonotes} % For todo notes in the margin, plus other features (refer to the documentation)
\usepackage{fancyhdr}					% Creates the fancy header
\usepackage{cancel}						% Math package to show cancellation
\usepackage{parskip}					% New paragraphs skip a line rather than indent
\usepackage{enumerate}					% For custom enumerations (refer to documentation)
\usepackage[colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue,linkbordercolor=white]{hyperref}	% Creates hyperlinks
\usepackage{xcolor}						% Extended coloring options (refer to documentation)
\usepackage{relsize}					% Can change size of math (refer to documentation)
\usepackage{tikz,pgfplots}				% The Tikz package is utilized for creating mathematical images, and PGFPlots provides tools for creating graphs
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.9}				% This gives PGFPlots backwards compatibility
\usepackage{framed}						% Framed environment puts a box around its contents (refer to documentation)
