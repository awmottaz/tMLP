%% SET THE LAYOUT OF THE PAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The 'layout' package gives the command '\layout' which, when used in the
%	beginning of your document, gives a summary of the various layout
%	measurements.
\usepackage{layout}

% We now customize the layout measurements. These are designed to work for any
%	paper size, e.g. a4paper, letterpaper, legalpaper, etc.
%	All dimensions are calculated based only on the size of the page and the
%	size of the font. Refer to the Usage Guide for the motivation behind this
%	definition.

\hoffset -0.03\paperwidth
\voffset -0.04\paperheight
\oddsidemargin 0pt
\topmargin 0pt
\headheight 1.3em
\headsep 1.3em
\textheight 0.78\paperheight
\textwidth 0.82\paperwidth
\marginparsep 1.5em
\marginparwidth 0.17\paperwidth
\footskip 2.5\headheight

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\newcommand{\concfont}{%		The classic font created by Donald Knuth

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% For basic math typesetting needs
\usepackage{mathtools,amsthm,amssymb}

% For double stroke fonts (\mathds{•}) and math script fonts (\mathscr{•})
\usepackage{dsfont,mathrsfs}

% Math package to show cancellation
\usepackage{cancel}

% For custom enumerations
% The 'shortlabels' option allows for the use of 'enumerate'-like definitions
%	of the labels.
\usepackage[shortlabels]{enumitem}

% For additional customization of tabular and array environments.
\usepackage{array}
% The 'array' package allows us to cure the problem of capitol letters
%	touching the '\hline's in a tabular environment.
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{1pt}

% This package allows the user to insert dashed lines in a tabular/array
%	environments.
% For vertical lines, use the ':' character in lieu of '|' as a column
%	separator.
% For horizontal lines, use the commands '\hdashline' and '\cdashline' in
%	place of '\hline' and 'cline'.
\usepackage{arydshln}

% Can change size of math
\usepackage{relsize}

% Extended coloring options
\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}

% The Tikz package is utilized for creating mathematical images, and PGFPlots 
% provides tools for creating graphs
\usepackage{tikz,pgfplots}
% This gives PGFPlots backwards compatibility
\pgfplotsset{compat = 1.10}
% This allows the user to use the PGFPlots feature 'fillbetween'
\usepgfplotslibrary{fillbetween}

% To correct proof environment spacing (see below)
\usepackage{needspace}

% For inserting todo notes and placeholders for missing figures.
\usepackage[textwidth=0.9\marginparwidth]{todonotes}

% Creates the fancy header
\usepackage{fancyhdr}

% New paragraphs skip a line rather than indent
\usepackage{parskip}

% Creates hyperlinks to section headings and labelled items.
\usepackage[
	colorlinks=true,
	linkcolor=blue,
	linkbordercolor=white,
	urlcolor=blue,
	unicode
	]{hyperref}

% Additional hyperlink possibilities
\usepackage{cleveref}

% Framed environment puts a box around its contents
\usepackage{framed}

% For some miscellaneous symbols
\usepackage{wasysym}

% For adding dummy text
\usepackage{lipsum}

% Utilized in footnote symbols definition (see below)
\usepackage{alphalph}

% For inserting PDF documents
\usepackage{pdfpages}


% Used in definition of '\signchart'
\usepackage{xstring}

% Extra control over figures. Use the 'H' placement character to mean
%	"here, no matter what"
\usepackage{float}

% For customizing tabular environments.
\usepackage{tabularx}

% These two packages allow for writing upright greek letters in text mode and
%	math mode, respectively, using commands such as '\textalpha',
%	'\textAlpha', '\upalpha', and '\Upalpha'.
\usepackage{textgreek,upgreek}

% For fancy customized verbatim environments
\usepackage{fancyvrb}

% For creating key-value pairs, used in the definition of '\signchart'
\usepackage{xkeyval}

%% USER DEFINED COMMANDS & MATH OPERATORS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Shortcuts for double stroke characters
% Note: One of the packages defines a command '\C'. I don't know which one
%	does it, nor do I know what the command does. So I am just ignoring it and
%	redefining it for my needs.
\newcommand{\N}{\mathds{N}}		% Naturals
\newcommand{\Z}{\mathds{Z}}		% Integers
\newcommand{\Q}{\mathds{Q}}		% Rationals
\newcommand{\R}{\mathds{R}}		% Reals
\renewcommand{\C}{\mathds{C}}	% Complex numbers
\renewcommand{\H}{\mathds{H}}	% Quaternions (Hamiltonions)
\newcommand{\F}{\mathds{F}}		% Generic field

%%%%% Various mathematical delimeters and reassignment of operators %%%%%%%%%%

% Places the argument inside auto-scaled parentheses
\newcommand{\paren}[1]{\left( #1 \right)}

% Places the argument inside auto-scaled angular brackets
\newcommand{\ang}[1]{\left\langle #1 \right\rangle}

\renewcommand{\bar}[1]{
\mkern 2mu\overline{\mkern-2mu#1\mkern-2mu}\mkern 2mu}

%%%%% User defined fraction-like objects: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The genfrac command takes 6 arguments.
% The first two arguments are optional left and right delimiters, respectively
% The third argument is an optional specification of the line thickness
% The fourth argument optionally overrides the mathstyle sizing.
% Use the following keys:
% 0--displaystyle, 1--textstyle, 2--scriptstyle, 3--scriptscriptstyle
% The fifth and sixth arguments are the numerator and denominator,
%	respectively.
% For example, a binomial coefficient would be created with this definition:
% \newcommand{\binom}[2]{\genfrac{(}{)}{0pt}{}{#1}{#2}}

%%%%% Math Operators %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Define some math operators
\DeclareMathOperator{\ord}{ord}		% Order

%%%%% Other Math-related Commands %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% I want math inside of the \textbf{•} command to also be bold
\DeclareTextFontCommand{\textbf}{\boldmath\bfseries}

% This command autmatically generates a sign chart.
% Syntax: \signchart{<list of values>}{<list of signs>}
% Example: \signchart{1,2,3}{+,-,+,-}
% Options: 'width' and 'height' change the width of the chart
%	and the height of the symbols, respectively.

\makeatletter

	\pgfmathtruncatemacro{\cutAmount}{\aLength + 1}
	\StrGobbleRight{\signs}{\cutAmount}[\almost]
	\StrBehind[\j]{,\almost}{,}[\s]
	
	% Calculate horizontal positions of number and sign
	\pgfmathsetmacro{\numpos}{(\wid/(\len+2))*(\i+1)}

	% Add the sign to the left of the tick mark.
	\node at (\signcoord,\snht) {$\s$};

% The sign to the right of the last tick mark is left out of the loop, so we

% 	and later use: '\cref{foo}'
\crefformat{footnote}{#2\footnotemark[#1]#3}



% The following command inverts the colors of the PDF output.
% This is nice while editing to lower eye strain.
% Note: This command requires the xcolor package.
\newcommand{\darktheme}{
\pagecolor[rgb]{0.1,0.1,0.1}

% This command allows inline numbers to be placed inside a circle.
% Note: This command requires the tikz package.
\newcommand*\circled[1]{\tikz[baseline=(char.base)]{

% Use the option 'align=margin' to place item labels in the left margin.
% Add the option 'labelsep=0pt' so that the content in the items is
%	properly aligned.
% Requires the 'enumitem' package.
% Example: \begin{enumerate}[align=margin,labelsep=0pt]
\SetLabelAlign{margin}{\llap{#1~~}}


% This command allows the user to specify the number of points a particular
% question is worth.
