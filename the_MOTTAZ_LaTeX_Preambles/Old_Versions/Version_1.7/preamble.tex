%% THE MOTTAZ UNIVERSAL LATEX PREAMBLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Created by: Tony Mottaz
%% Description: This is my customized preamble with which I write all of my
%%	homework assignments. It is ever-expanding to fit new and nitpicky uses.
%% Please refer to the README for change log, goals for the future, and other
%%	info.

%% SET THE LAYOUT OF THE PAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The 'layout' package gives the command '\layout' which, when used in the
%	beginning of your document, gives a summary of the various layout
%	measurements.
\usepackage{layout}

% We now customize the layout measurements. These are designed to work for any
%	paper size, e.g. a4paper, letterpaper, legalpaper, etc.
%	All dimensions are calculated based only on the size of the page and the
%	size of the font. Refer to the Usage Guide for the motivation behind this
%	definition.

\hoffset 0.06\paperwidth
\voffset -0.025\paperheight
\oddsidemargin 0pt
\topmargin 0pt
\headheight 1.3em
\headsep 1.3em
\textheight 0.78\paperheight
\textwidth 0.59\paperwidth
\marginparsep 1.5em
\marginparwidth 0.17\paperwidth
\footskip 2.5\headheight

%% PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% For basic math typesetting needs
\usepackage{mathtools,amsthm,amssymb}

% For double stroke fonts (\mathds{•}) and math script fonts (\mathscr{•})
\usepackage{dsfont,mathrsfs}

% Math package to show cancellation
\usepackage{cancel}

% For custom enumerations
% The 'shortlabels' option allows for the use of 'enumerate'-like definitions
%	of the labels.
\usepackage[shortlabels]{enumitem}

% For additional customization of tabular and array environments.
\usepackage{array}
% The 'array' package allows us to cure the problem of capitol letters
%	touching the '\hline's in a tabular environment.
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{1pt}

% This package allows the user to insert dashed lines in a tabular/array
%	environments.
% For vertical lines, use the ':' character in lieu of '|' as a column
%	separator.
% For horizontal lines, use the commands '\hdashline' and '\cdashline' in
%	place of '\hline' and 'cline'.
\usepackage{arydshln}

% Can change size of math
\usepackage{relsize}

% Extended coloring options
\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}

% The Tikz package is utilized for creating mathematical images, and PGFPlots 
% provides tools for creating graphs
\usepackage{tikz,pgfplots}
% This gives PGFPlots backwards compatibility
\pgfplotsset{compat = 1.10}
% This allows the user to use the PGFPlots feature 'fillbetween'
\usepgfplotslibrary{fillbetween}

% To correct proof environment spacing (see below)
\usepackage{needspace}

% For inserting todo notes and placeholders for missing figures.
\usepackage[textwidth=0.9\marginparwidth]{todonotes}

%% USER DEFINED COMMANDS & MATH OPERATORS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Shortcuts for double stroke characters
% Note: One of the packages defines a command '\C'. I don't know which one
%	does it, nor do I know what the command does. So I am just ignoring it and
%	redefining it for my needs.
\newcommand{\N}{\mathds{N}}		% Naturals
\newcommand{\Z}{\mathds{Z}}		% Integers
\newcommand{\Q}{\mathds{Q}}		% Rationals

% The third argument is an optional specification of the line thickness
% The fourth argument optionally overrides the mathstyle sizing.
% Use the following keys:

%% OTHER FEATURES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% I prefer a proof to start on a new page if 3 lines or fewer of the proof
%	will only be seen on a single page. The 'needspace' package does this for
%	me quite nicely.

% First, copy '\proof' and '\endproof' to avoid infinite loop errors:
\expandafter\let\expandafter\oldproof\csname\string\proof\endcsname
\let\oldendproof\endproof

% Now we can redefine the proof environment:
\renewenvironment{proof}[1][\proofname]{%
	\Needspace*{4\baselineskip} \oldproof[#1]}
	{\oldendproof}
	
	
	
% For referencing multiple items to single footnote,
% 	use '\footnote{\label{foo}<text in the footnote>}',
% 	and later use: '\cref{foo}'
\crefformat{footnote}{#2\footnotemark[#1]#3}



% The following command inverts the colors of the PDF output.
% This is nice while editing to lower eye strain.
% Note: This command requires the xcolor package.
\newcommand{\darktheme}{
\pagecolor[rgb]{0.1,0.1,0.1}
\color[rgb]{0.95,0.95,0.95}
}



% This command allows inline numbers to be placed inside a circle.
% Note: This command requires the tikz package.
\newcommand*\circled[1]{\tikz[baseline=(char.base)]{
    \node[shape=circle,draw,inner sep=1pt] (char) {#1};}}


 
% Use the option 'align=margin' to place item labels in the left margin.
% Add the option 'labelsep=0pt' so that the content in the items is
%	properly aligned.
% Requires the 'enumitem' package.
% Example: \begin{enumerate}[align=margin,labelsep=0pt]
\SetLabelAlign{margin}{\llap{#1~~}}



% The next two commands allow the user to optionally place 'definition'
%	environments or 'theorem/lemma/proposition/corollary' environments
%	in a frame. Insert the command '\frameddefinitions' to turn on frames
%	for the 'definition' environment, and insert the command '\framedtheorems'
%	to turn on frames for the 'theorem/lemma/proposition/corollary'
%	environments.

\newcommand{\frameddefinitions}{
