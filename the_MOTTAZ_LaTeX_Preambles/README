    INTRO:  This README is a jump start guide to using the various preambles in
            this collection. Refer to the log files for changes and updates for
            each preamble in this collection.

    LICENSE:    This project is released under the LaTeX Project Public
                License, v1.3c or later. See

                   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt

HOW TO USE
==========
    1. Save the file '<edition>_preamble.tex' to your system.
    2. In your LaTeX document, before '\begin{document}', insert the following:

            \input{/path/to/<edition>_preamble.tex}

        where '/path/to/<edition>_preamble.tex' is the location of
        '<edition>_preamble.tex' on your system.
    3. If applicable, be sure to set the content in the header of your document.
    4. If you obtain errors in your first compilation, then look in the POSSIBLE
        ISSUES section below for a solution. If your error is not addressed
        there, please email me with a description of the problem that arose.
    5. A thorough usage guide is provided (Usage_Guide.pdf) for your reference.
        -NOTE- the current Usage Guide is outdated. A new version is on the way!

POSSIBLE ISSUES
===============
    - The following packages are required by some preambles, and may not already
      be installed on your LaTeX system.
        * pgfplots version 1.10
        * arydshln
        * greek-fontenc
        * babel-greek
        * cbfonts
        * cbfonts-fd
        * signchart

    - If you change the font, you might get one of several warnings:
        * 'No room for a new \mathgroup' => I have not found a solution to
            this error. If you know one, please let me know. Otherwise, you
            must choose a different font.
        * 'auto expansion is only possible with scalable fonts' => This error
            is caused by the package 'microtype'. To use the font, simply
            comment out this line in the preamble:
                \usepackage{microtype}

    - DO NOT change the order in which packages are loaded. The order matters
        when setting up options and considering dependencies. If you change
        the order in which packages are loaded, you may get several errors
        such as an option clash or double-defining a command.

THANKS
======
    - A special thanks to Aaron Zolotor for his help in the initial progress and
        development of these preambles. He continues to put up with my ramblings
        about different features I want to add, suggests features of his own,
        and provides very useful feedback.                                                                    	|
    - Thanks to Mac Gallagher for sharing with me the preambles he uses. Nearly
        all of the additions in version 1.5 were due to his input.
